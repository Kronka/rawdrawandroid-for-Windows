# rawdrawandroid-for-Windows
Previously, I could not build it on windows, but now I have done it easily and simply

# What's it?  
This is a copy of the repository: https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid  
I mainly touched on the Makefile, I had to fix and change something there to build the application on Windows  
  
# How to build it?

1. You must have installed:  
- **Android SDK (android-29 / 30 / 31, to choose from)**  
- **Build-tools (i installed 31.0.0)**  
- **NDK (i installed 23.0.7599858, it can be newer)**  
- **7-zip**  
- **you should install gnuwin32 3.81 (and newer)**  
Review the Makefile and change the relative paths to your folders. You may also have to change the path to 7-zip
